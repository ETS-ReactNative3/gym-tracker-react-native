# gym-tracker-react-native

### TLDR Description
Native android app to record workouts in the gym. 
Part of a larger web app project.
Hooked into a Node-Mongo server.

### Description
This is part of a MERN web app eco-system hosted on AWS. 
The backend is a MongoDB database hosted on Mongo Atlas, accessed through a Node-Express server (running on AWS).
The initial inspiration for this project was to open up my gym data so I can monitor my fitness and gym performance more closely, importing it into a database (which will form another project).
